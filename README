This is a set of scripts for NFV testing.
Test scenario: vhost-user + multi-queue + MoonGen + testpmd + non-rt kernel + qemu-kvm-rhev
Environment preparation: two hosts, one for MoonGen, one for guest

1. install two hosts, with non-rt kernel(do not need to install any additional packages)
2. git clone this repo to host1
3. run the main script nfv-ovsdpdk-vhostuser.sh on host1(check IP, network card PCI address in the script first)
	1. setup environment on host1, including packages install, hugepages allocation, tftp and web server
	2. install a guest on host1
	3. start testpmd on guest(to decide to use how many multi-queues, is accrding to host1 cpu numbers in total)
		mq1: 3 vcpus in total(assigned to guest, in xml)
		mq4: -l(in testpmd) should be 9, 4 for one side packet forwarding, the other 4 for another side, 1 for master thread.
			9 vcpus assigned to guest(in xml), 4 vcpus bind to ovs-dpdk, 13 vcpus in total.
		mq8: 17 vcpus assigned to guest(in xml), 8 vcpus bind to ovs-dpdk, 25 vcpus in total
	4. setup environment on host2, including MoonGen compile and installation
	5. run l2 latency on host2 with MoonGen
